title: Multipart Request (File Upload)
---

GraphQL Helix implements [GraphQL Multipart specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec). So file uploads are supported by GraphQL Helix out-of-box.

All you need to do is to add a scalar type specific for Blob/File.

This special type implements both W3 [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) and `graphql-upload`'s [FileUpload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-upload) type;

See [here](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix/tree/master/examples/file-upload) for an example.
