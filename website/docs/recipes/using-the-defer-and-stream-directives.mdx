title: Using the `@defer` and `@stream` directives
---

GraphQL Helix supports `@defer` and `@stream` directives out-of-the-box, provided you use the appropriate version of `graphql-js`. When either directive is used, `processRequest` will return a `MULTIPART_RESPONSE` result, which you can then use to return a `multipart/mixed` response. You can use `sendResult` or `sendMultipartResponseResult` helpers to send a valid response strucut easily. Here's an example of how this is implemented behind the scenes:

```ts
// This is what sendResult / sendMultipartResponseResult is doing behind the scenes
if (result.type === "MULTIPART_RESPONSE") {
  // Indicate that this is a multipart response and the connection should be kept open.
  res.writeHead(200, {
    Connection: "keep-alive",
    "Content-Type": 'multipart/mixed; boundary="-"',
    "Transfer-Encoding": "chunked",
  });

  // If the client closes the connection, we unsubscribe to prevent memory leaks.
  req.on("close", () => {
    result.unsubscribe();
  });

  res.write("---");

  // Subscribe to new results. The callback will be called with the
  // ExecutionResult object that should be sent back to the client for each chunk.
  for await (const payload of result) {
    const chunk = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(payload), "utf8");
    const data = ["Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8", "Content-Length: " + String(chunk.length), "", chunk];

    if (payload.hasNext) {
      data.push("---");
    }

    res.write(data.join("\r\n"));
  }

  // The Promise returned by `subscribe` will only resolve once all chunks have been emitted,
  // at which point we can end the request.
  res.write("\r\n-----\r\n");
  res.end();
}
```

See the [here](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix/tree/master/examples/express) for a complete example.

The examples used in this repo are compatible with client-side libraries like [meros](https://github.com/maraisr/meros) and [fetch-multipart-graphql](https://github.com/relay-tools/fetch-multipart-graphql).
